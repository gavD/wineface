WineFace
========

Trouble remembering what wines you like? Not any more! Simply scan the barcode and then make a face. Then, any time you scan that barcode in future, you'll see the face you made and know if you enjoyed it or not!

One button, nice and easy!

Apparently, wine critics recommendations are a really poor way of figuring out what wines you would like (TODO link). Why not rely on your own reactions instead? After all, all that matters is whether YOU like it!
